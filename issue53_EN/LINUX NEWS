Ubuntu Store Open To App Devs

Canonical has launched its app developer web site in a bid to persuade developers to port applications over to its Ubuntu Linux distribution. Ubuntu's Software Centre is Canonical's app store for its popular Ubuntu Linux distribution, offering both free and paid applications. Hardened Linux users will look upon it as a graphical front end to Dselect, but Canonical has put a lot of work into its Software Centre to not only generate cash but also make Ubuntu easier to use.

Steve George, VP of business development at Canonical said, "The Ubuntu developer site aims to help put Ubuntu on the app development map. We want to provide a platform that makes it easier for developers to create applications and distribute them to millions of Ubuntu users."

Ubuntu One Windows Client

If you look at the marketplace for cloud based storage at the moment, some of the most successful services have one thing in common: they work everywhere. Look at Dropbox, for example, which has clients on all the major desktop operating systems as well as apps for iOS and Android.

Canonical wants, and needs, the same multi-platform service if Ubuntu One is going to survive and flourish, and admits its users are a diverse bunch who don’t just use Ubuntu. With that in mind, they have launched a fully-featured Windows client for the service.

MY DESKTOP

Your chance to show the world your desktop or PC. Email your screenshots and photos to: misc@fullcirclemagazine.org and include a brief paragraph about your desktop, your PC's specs and any other interesting tidbits about your setup.

I'm from Indonesia, and this is my first participation in FCM.

I run Ubuntu 10.10 on an old low-end PC, P4 1.6 GHz, 512 SDRAM, 40 GB HDD, Nvidia Geforce2 TI, 15" CRT monitor.

All runs great here. I use Unity 2d with mac4lin theme and genoid icons. Compiz works in minimal settings since there's a warning on compizchecker. I put together 3 rcs into 1 conky.

Ubuntu rocks.

I took this screenshot some time ago, when I used Ubuntu 10.10. Now I'm using 11.04. In fact I like using Unity because it's simple, and satisfies what I need.

I like my desktop simple, and with no icons, so I removed the top panel and used the bottom panel with the dockbarx applet and gnomenu instead of the default one. I got the wallpaper from deviantart.

My computer specs: Toshiba Satellite A135-s2276, Intel Pentium Dual-Core 1.6 GHz, RAM 3GB, ATI Radeon 128MB (Shared) and a 320GB HDD.

This is Ubuntu 11.04 Natty Narwhal, running on my 14" laptop, with Intel Celeron CPU 550 @ 2.00GHz and 1GB of RAM.

I disabled Nautilus showing mounted volumes on the desktop to provide a cleaner desktop.

The wallpaper is Stripes, the default wallpaper of GNOME 3 (Hey, it looks good with Unity :D ). I use the Radiance theme, retouched with Faenza Icon Set. There are two Screenlets, ClearCalendar with Noback theme, and Lipik with a theme I made myself, Tempel, which can be found at http://i-n-o-e.deviantart.com/art/Screenlets-Lipik-tempel-1-0-208444137

This is my idea of a perfect desktop, something thatâ€™s neat, simple, and minimalistic. Not too many short-cuts on the unity launcher bar, but with a little coding of Unity Quicklist scripts, navigation becomes just as good as any other bulky Unity launcher bar. I like this style because it's suitable for serious work and looks good too.

This is my desktop screenshot.  My OS is a homemade mixture from Debian base, Ubuntu, Back Track, Hymera, and a lot of extra repositories. I'm using a lot of software for astronomy, radio communication, and spectral analysis.

This is my screenshot on my laptop, it is an HP from 2006, but works nicely to surf the Internet, write mail, read newspapers, and use the bank. I like Unity - easy to use on the laptop - and I use gkrellm to monitor.

I am running Ubuntu 10.10 on a Dell Vostro laptop - with Intel core 2 duo, 2GB RAM, 160GB HDD, resolution is set to 1280*800. I have been using Ubuntu since 8.04, and, since then, I am in love with it. I am using Ambiance theme with wallpaper from Ubuntu-art.org. The bottom dock is aligned using AWN manager; for the gadgets I am using screenlets. My friends ask me which operating system is this!! (open mouthed).

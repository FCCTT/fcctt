I think this is the age range where the majority of Linux users are today -- most are college students and young professionals. (20-29)

Young people might have more knowledge to separate a computer from an OS, and they are willing to try something new. (20-29)

No longer caught up in fads and peer pressure. (40-49)

I imagine younger users don't really care about their choice of OS, and only know Windows or Apple OS. (30-39)

Silver Surfers want a fast, easy, dependable PC! (60-69)

Visual observation at Ohio Linux Fest (40-49)

When they become aware of the Microsoft tax! (30-39)

That was the age I got started, and older people usually want the corporate jobs. This means Windows is predominantly used. (20-29)

I see more and more young people using Linux, whereas I think most of the older people just stick with the preinstalled Windows, which just works. (20-29)

Welcome to another issue of Full Circle!

After all the negativity surrounding Unity and Ubuntu 11.04, I've written an article about KDE. As many of you will know, I used to use KDE back in the 3.5 days, but when the 4.0 debacle happened I jumped ship and went to default Gnome flavored Ubuntu. KDE has now matured enough in 4.6 that it's pretty much back on form with its 3.5 days, so Kubuntu 11.04 is on my desktop machine. Have a read through the article, and watch the video I made, maybe you'll take a shine to KDE and forget about any horror you may have with Unity.

I'd also like to take this opportunity to wish Greg a happy second anniversary! Greg (Mr. Python) has been writing his HowTo series now for two years. This month he brings you Part 24. Send him an email of thanks, I'm sure he'll appreciate it.

Our cover story this issue is PAM, and facial recognition technology. Call it coincidence, but just days before this issue was compiled, the stories hit the headlines (here in the UK) about Facebook automatically using facial recognition technology on people's photographs to automatically tag photos with users' names. PAM doesn't quite go that far, but it does allow you to use your face as your login. Just don't break your nose, or get plastic surgery!

And finally, I think this month's My Opinion might spark some controversy with one reader saying that the downfall of Ubuntu will be none other than... Canonical! I'm interested in what other readers will have to say about that piece.

All the best, and keep in touch.

HOW-TO
Written by Ronnie Tucker
Write For Full Circle Magazine

Guidelines

The single rule for an article is that it must somehow be linked to Ubuntu or one of the many derivatives of Ubuntu (Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Lubuntu, etc).

Write your article in whichever software you choose. I would recommend OpenOffice, but PLEASE SPELL AND GRAMMAR CHECK IT!

Writing

In your article, please indicate where you would like a particular image to be placed. Please do not embed images into your Open Office document.

Images

Images should be JPG with low compression.

Regarding image sizes: if in doubt, send a full size screengrab and we will crop the image.
If you are writing a review, please follow the guidelines shown here.

For a more detailed list of the style rules and common pitfalls please refer to: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuMagazine/Style - in short: US spelling, no l33t speak and no smilies.

When you are ready to submit your article please email it to: articles@fullcirclemagazine.org

If you can't write articles, but hang out in Ubuntu Forums, send us interesting forum threads that we could print.

Non-English Writers

If your native language is not English, don't worry. Write your article, and one of the proofreaders will read it for you and correct any grammatical or spelling errors. Not only are you helping the magazine and the community, but we'll help you with your English!


REVIEWS

Games/Applications
When reviewing games/applications please state clearly:

•  title of the game
•  who makes the game
•  is it free, or a paid download?
•  where to get it from (give download/homepage URL)
•  is it Linux native, or did you use Wine?
•  your marks out of five
•  a summary with positive and negative points

Hardware
When reviewing hardware please state clearly:

•  make and model of the hardware
•  what category would you put this hardware into?
•  any glitches that you may have had while using the hardware?
•  easy to get the hardware working in Linux?
•  did you have to use Windows drivers?
•  marks out of five
•  a summary with positive and negative points

You don't need to be an expert to write an article - write about the games, applications and hardware that you use every day.

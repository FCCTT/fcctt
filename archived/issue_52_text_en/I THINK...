Last month's question was:
Would you like to see a series of articles on audio editing with Audacity?


Please include the swh plugins if you do the series.

Add narrative and music tracks to slide shows.

I need to know how to record anti-Unity comments in Audacity.

Please start with the basics!


It would be nice to see what Audacity can really do beyond the most basic editing functions that I use.

I'm not interested in audio editing.

Yes. Noise removal & volume boosting without clipping!

I've just unsuccessfully tried to prepare a mix (simple fade-out, fade-in) but could not get the way to "align" the quasi-end of a song with the beginning of the next one.

Audacity is simple and well documented

Would be very interested since Audacity has lots of unknown functionalities for me!

Sound editing is a topic which is not touched very often in magazines. It'd be awesome to have a series in FCM regarding casual audio editing in audacity.


The question I'd like to pose for FCM#53 is:

With the rise of web-based email, do we need an email client installed by default?

Welcome to another issue of Full Circle!

Three new series start this month. Two of them are HowTo articles: How To Use Ubuntu in Home, Business and Education, and the other is on how to use the genealogy application GRAMPS. This means you now have five HowTo articles this month, and probably every month from now on. The third new item is in Linux Labs, and that's on my exploits with ZoneMinder and a webcam to create a simple CCTV system. 

Although you now have five HowTo articles, I have only have enough screens for one more month of My Desktop, so now is a good time to submit your desktop screenshot and info. If you want, send us a photo of your actual desktop/laptop, and it's specs, and we'll do a My PC section too. I'm also all out of My Opinion articles, so feel free to email in your Ubuntu/Linux rants. Please note: no Unity rants! We've covered how most people seem to despise it, so no need to reinvent the wheel. It's that or I keep printing Robin Catling's rants. Which, now that I think about it, don't seem to provoke the same response that they used to. Is it Robin who's going soft, or you guys (and gals)?

I'm also looking for feedback from you, the readers, on the magazine's contents. Is there a section you don't like, or think is pointless? Is there a section you'd like to see added? Please bear in mind though that the regular writers and myself can write only about what we know. But that's why I like it when you folks send us your articles on subjects that we don't know anything about, or rarely cover. So, don't be shy, send us your articles about anything Ubuntu or Linux related. The more unusal and obscure the better! As long as you give it a quick second read, and double check your spelling, the awesome FCM proof-readers will edit it for you.

All the best, and keep in touch.

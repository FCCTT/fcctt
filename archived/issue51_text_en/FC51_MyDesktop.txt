I took this screenshot before upgrading to 11.04 because I don't know what will happen with my existing desktop configuration since 11.04 will use Unity by default.

The dock at the bottom of the screen is AWN, and I have various screenlets on the right side of the screen, and 2 sticker screenlets toward the left side of the screen - to try and make them look as though they are hanging on the wall.

My computer is a Toshiba Satellite L655-S5157, with an Intel i3 processor, 4 GB of RAM (even though I'm running 32-bit Ubuntu to help ensure that device drivers work with my hardware - I still had to do some tweaking to get the wireless adapter to work and the headphones jack to work), and I upgraded to a 750 GB hard drive.

I took this picture some time ago. It's not really my idea of a perfect desktop, but I had fun doing it.

Software used: emerald theme manager, compiz, AWN, screenlets (with quick folder applets intalled), and, not to be forgotten, Cairo Dock, all running on Ubuntu 10.10, with GNOME 2.32. 

Cairo Dock is heavy, and you need to have a good computer running it or you will end up having a turtle system.

Computer hardware specification: Compaq presario CQ42 203AU, RAM 3GB, graphic card ATI radeon 1GB, hard disk 320GB.

This is my Ubuntu 10.10 desktop. I like this setup because of its simplicity and yet classic and sophisticated feel. I downloaded the wallpaper from:
http://linuxhub.net/2010/01/top-35-handpicked-ubuntu-wallpapers/, used the theme Dust, adjusted the screen resolution to 1280 x 1024, and set the panels to transparent (right-click > properties...). Below that is the Cairo dock. My PC specs are:

• Dual-core 2.5 GHz
• 2GB RAM	
• Integrated Graphics 256 MB

Apropos of "The Netbook is Not Dead Yet" by Allan J. Smithie in issue #49 of Full Circle, my desktop is running on an Asus EEE-PC 900E, and it runs wonderful on it. Listening to music using either Audacious (right hand corner) or Banshee Media Player, the default player, is just perfect. The wallpaper is from:

I'm always on deviantart looking for Ubuntu wallpapers - wonderful site for it. The skin is elementary, and the icon is Faenza-Dark set.

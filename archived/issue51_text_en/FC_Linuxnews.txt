Indian Courts To Use Ubuntu

For the past four years all Indian Courts have been using RedHat Enterprise 5. Now, the Supreme Court of India has directed all Courts (approximately 17,000 of them) to change to Ubuntu 10.04. The Supreme Court of India has also given all Courts a customized Ubuntu DVD.

Each Court uses at least five computers. That's five computers multiplied by seventeen thousand Courts. That's 85,000 computers that will get Ubuntu

The Supreme Court of India committee page in which all the Indian Courts are directed to install Ubuntu is at: http://www.sci.nic.in/e-committee.htm

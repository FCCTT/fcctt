Welcome to another issue of Full Circle!

Another new How-To series for you this month, Backup Strategy. In this, the first of serveral parts, Allan discusses where you should keep your physical backup. In future issues he'll be discussing backup applications (such as Deja-Dup which will come as standard with Ubuntu 11.10), and, of course, storing your backup in 'the cloud'.

I want to take a few moments to send a special message of congratulations to the entire Italian translation team. They've been bashing out back issues in Italian now at quite a pace, and are the first (and, so far, only) translation team to translate every single issue of FCM!

I also want to thank you, the readers, for stepping up and bombarding me with emails about my latest FCM idea. If you're not on the mailing list (head over to fullcirclemagazine.org and sign up to get first knowledge of new issues and exclusive emails) let me fill you in: my idea is to start a new feature in FCM where I take a Windows feature and show the *buntu equivalent. I say *buntu as I want to show how things are done in Gnome, KDE, LXDE and XFCE. I was sent many good ideas, so that new feature will start in FCM#54. And I want to thank each and every one of you who emailed me wanting to help with this idea. I wish I could have picked you all, but I only needed a couple of people whom I have now contacted. If you weren't successful in helping with this new feature: don't get sad, get writing! Write about whatever it is you do with your *buntu as it will help someone out there. The more quirky the better. If you use it for science, or medicine then let us know what software you're using, and how it helps you.

All the best, and keep in touch.

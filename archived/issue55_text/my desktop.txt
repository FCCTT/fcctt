My desktop is a tribute for the legend of heavy-metal, Dimebag Darrell. I'm using a Mike Capprotti drawing about this legendary guitar player.

I'm using Cairo-Dock for taskbar and shortcurts.

My specs: Acer Aspire 3050-1458, AMD Sempron 3500+ 1.8 GHz, 1,5GB RAM, and 80 GB.

This is my desktop. I like it clean and simple.

I am running Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, with Docky (bottom & left-hand side docks, auto-hide), and panel on top (auto-hide). Wallpaper is ubuntu-black - can't remember where it came from. Screenlets are circle clock, and three ring sensors showing hard drive space.

I've been using Ubuntu since '05, loving the progress.

The wallpaper, a picture I took of a leaf bug. The theme is called Bamboo-zen created by Zgegball. I also use Zgegball's icons - itâ€™s called ubuntu-sunrise. There are 5 screenlets, Calender with no back, A clock, a bulls eye, which I just have because I think it looks nice. The word of the day to stay up on my vocab, CPU usage, and, last but not least, the Cairo-Dock. 

The green gives me an earthly feel.

System Specs:Ubuntu 10.04 (lucid) running on my Dell xps one, with an Intel Core(TM) dual processor 2.3Ghz, 4GBs of ram, 300GB Harddrive space.

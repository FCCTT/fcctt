This is my desktop screenshot, Ubuntu 10.04 with default wallpaper and theme. I was inspired by an Internet caf√© in my hometown. I prefer using one panel on the bottom side and icon arrangement on screen. I've been doing some Ubuntu beginner lessons with neighbors, so I think with these settings they'll get familiar with it and it'll remain easy to understand.

My specs are:
AMD Athlon 64 x2 3600+ Dual-Core Processor, 2GB RAM, 80GB HD Drive, Nvidia 7300 GT

The Conky is homemade with the batmanforeveralternate font. The lower dock is Cairo, with mostly Fekete icons - except for the launcher, which is a custom Awoken folder icon. The dock up right is AWN with Awoke icons. I also use cardapio for the menu.

All this, and much more, runs on my Belinea o.book 1301: Intel Centrino dual core
2GB RAM , and
13 inch screen which runs with a 1280x800 resolution.

This is my Natty KDE desktop. Kwin can do all the things I know Compiz can do, but seems to handle crashes better. I am using a Wubi install within MS Vista. My desktop layout is set to "Search and Launch" which serves as a great replacement for Cairo Dock.

Coming from GNOME after 5 releases, KDE is finally as easy to use as GNOME and with better stability. However, I had to struggle to get Flash player to work for multimedia in Web browsing.
I have both Unity and KDE (no clashing I've come across).

My PC Specs:

Nothing too fancy over my computer specs; this is my computer at the office where I do most of my work. I use AWN (deleted all the GNOME panels), and Conky. Also covered my ALT+F2 needs with Synapse. Icons are Awoken Dark, and while I'm not doing presentations or out-of-office work, I switch over to Buuf icons.

Guidelines

The single rule for an article is that it must somehow be linked to Ubuntu or one of the many derivatives of Ubuntu (Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Lubuntu, etc).

Write your article in whichever software you choose. I would recommend OpenOffice, but PLEASE SPELL AND GRAMMAR CHECK IT!

Writing

In your article, please indicate where you would like a particular image to be placed. Please do not embed images into your Open Office document.

Images

Images should be JPG with low compression.

Regarding image sizes: if in doubt, send a full size screengrab and we will crop the image.
If you are writing a review, please follow the guidelines shown here.

For a more detailed list of the style rules and common pitfalls please refer to: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuMagazine/Style - in short: US spelling, no l33t speak and no smilies.

When you are ready to submit your article please email it to: articles@fullcirclemagazine.org

If you can't write articles, but hang out in Ubuntu Forums, send us interesting forum threads that we could print.

Non-English Writers

If your native language is not English, don't worry. Write your article, and one of the proofreaders will read it for you and correct any grammatical or spelling errors. Not only are you helping the magazine and the community, but we'll help you with your English!
